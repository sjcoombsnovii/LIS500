                <h2>Introduction to Implicit Bias</h2>
                <p>Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner. These biases, which encompass both favorable and unfavorable assessments, are activated involuntarily and without an individual's awareness or intentional control.</p>

                <h2>How Could Implicit Bias Affect Your Interactions?</h2>
                <p>Implicit bias continues to follow us from childhood all the way to adulthood. Many of our biases are from being raised a certain way & who we are surrounded by. Detering away from this biases, can be a challenge in itself. However, this can be important because, implicit bias can lead to the following: </p>

                <h2>The Implicit Association Test (IAT)</h2>
                <p>The <a href="https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html" target="_blank">Implicit Association Test (IAT)</a> is a tool designed to measure implicit attitudes and beliefs that people may be unwilling or unable to report. It's widely used in social psychology research to study various types of bias, including racial bias, gender bias, and age bias.</p>

                <h2>Intersectionality</h2>
                <p>Intersectionality is a theoretical framework for understanding how aspects of a person's social and political identities (e.g., gender, race, class, sexuality, disability) might combine to create unique modes of discrimination and privilege. This concept is crucial for understanding the complexity of implicit bias.</p>

                <img src="intersectionality.png">
                <p>Each of these aspects adds a layer to a person's lived experience. For instance, a Black woman might face discrimination differently than a disabled female or a disabled man in poverty because of the compounded effects of race and gender. Adding more elements like class or sexuality can further affect their experience, making it essential to view discrimination and inequality through an intersectional lens.</p>

                <h2>Educating Others Through Media</h2>
                <p>Media has long been a powerful tool for both reflecting societal norms and challenging them. In the 1971 animated film The Point by Harry Nilsson, the main character, Oblio, has a unique experience because he is the only person in his town without a pointed head. This story provides a metaphor for feeling out of place or “different” and can open discussions about how societal norms exclude and marginalize people based on arbitrary attributes. Although The Point doesn’t explicitly address intersectionality, it highlights the feeling of otherness and can be used to introduce audiences to the concept of how people with multiple marginalized identities may feel excluded in various aspects of society.</p>

                <p>Over time, media representations of intersectionality have evolved, but challenges remain. Shows like Orange is the New Black provide narratives that combine race, gender, sexuality, and class to highlight complex intersections. Although these portrayals have increased awareness, there is still a need for more nuanced representations that educate viewers on the multiple layers of identity and how they interact to impact individuals’ lives.</p>

                <h2>Educating and Inspiring Change</h2>
                <p>Addressing intersectionality requires a multi-faceted approach in education, policy-making, and media:</p>
                <div class="achieve">
                    <ul>
                     <li>Educational Institutions: Schools and universities can integrate intersectionality into curriculums to educate students on the significance of interconnected identities. Programs and discussions can help young people understand their own identities and those of others.</li>
                     <li>Policy Advocacy: Addressing intersectional discrimination in policy is so important. This could include programs for minority groups, healthcare reforms to tackle systemic bias, or workplace policies that ensure equitable treatment for individuals from various backgrounds.</li>
                     <li>Media Representation: Continued representation in films, music, and literature can challenge stereotypes and highlight diverse experiences. Social media has also become a powerful platform for individuals to share their stories, create community awareness, and push for changes.</li>
