                <h2>Our Project Statement</h2>
                <p>In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), tools like Google’s Teachable Machines have made AI more accessible, empowering users without technical expertise to engage creatively with this transformative technology. Our project focuses on developing a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using this platform, showcasing how AI can recognize and interpret human gestures in real time. Machine learning plays a crucial role in enabling this functionality by allowing the system to identify patterns in the data and make accurate predictions based on those patterns. Unlike traditional programming, where explicit rules must be coded for every scenario, machine learning empowers the system to learn and improve from examples, making it adaptable and scalable for real-world applications. Beyond its technical merits, the project serves as a medium to explore the broader implications of AI, particularly its role in education, accessibility, and ethical considerations.</p>

                <p>However, while machine learning has transformative potential, it also comes with critical challenges that must be addressed. AI systems, especially those trained on limited datasets, often exhibit biases that can lead to unfair or exclusionary outcomes. These biases can arise from underrepresented data, lack of diversity in training samples, or systemic oversights in algorithm design. This is particularly problematic when AI is used in scenarios requiring fairness, such as educational or interactive tools designed for diverse audiences. Our project addresses this issue by striving to make the model inclusive and transparent while showcasing how AI can be applied responsibly in interactive and educational contexts. By using a simple game format, we aim to highlight these challenges and explore solutions in a way that is engaging and accessible to users.</p>

                <p>The project utilizes Teachable Machines to simplify AI training processes by collecting diverse datasets of hand gestures, training a model for high accuracy, and integrating real-time predictions into an interactive game interface. This approach highlights the potential of AI to educate users about its capabilities while demonstrating the importance of inclusivity and fairness in technology. As the project unfolded, lessons from Joy Buolamwini’s Unmasking AI resonated deeply, influencing its ethical direction. Buolamwini’s concept of the “coded gaze,” which highlights how biases in AI creators shape algorithms, emphasized the importance of creating diverse and representative training datasets for the game. Her insights encouraged us to ensure our model accommodates users of various skin tones, hand shapes, and environmental conditions, fostering inclusivity in our design. We incorporated images with different skin tones, different clothing attire, different hand sizes, different jewelry, to compensate for this bias. </p>
                    
                <p>The book also underscored the need for ethical accountability in AI development, reminding us to communicate the model's limitations and ethical considerations transparently to users. By addressing the potential pitfalls of AI, such as embedded biases and the risks of misuse, we strive to create a learning experience that informs participants about responsible AI use. We also acknowledge that the machine will have inherent biases, as no AI system is immune to the influences of its training data and the environments in which it operates. While we endeavor to create a robust and fair system by using diverse datasets and adopting inclusive design practices, it is impossible to foresee every situation or edge case that users might encounter. These limitations are not an excuse but a responsibility we actively embrace. By holding ourselves accountable for these shortcomings, we aim to build trust, remain transparent, and continuously improve the system. Acknowledging these biases is a step toward ensuring that AI systems, like ours, are used ethically and that users are aware of the system's constraints. This transparency fosters critical engagement and helps cultivate a more nuanced understanding of the promises and challenges of AI. Buolamwini’s call to center marginalized voices in AI conversations inspired our commitment to making the project accessible to users of all ages, abilities, and backgrounds, ensuring it serves as an inclusive tool for engagement and education. This is done through allowing our machine to be used on our website, as well as, including videos and images of our machine at work, if the user is unable to access the actual machine.</p>
                    
                <p>Moreover, the concept of algorithmic justice from Unmasking AI guided our project’s philosophy. By critically examining the fairness of our system, we aimed to avoid perpetuating harmful biases and encouraged participants to reflect on AI’s social implications. These principles align with Buolamwini’s vision of recoding AI to prioritize justice, equity, and accountability. This project not only demonstrates AI’s technical potential but also stimulates meaningful discussions about its ethical and societal impacts. It highlights AI's ability to educate and engage while emphasizing the importance of creating systems that are transparent, inclusive, and representative of diverse communities. As a result, this simple game becomes a catalyst for exploring the transformative possibilities and responsibilities of AI in shaping a more equitable future.</p>
